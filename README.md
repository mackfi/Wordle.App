# Overview

This is a .NET MAUI app that uses [this data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cprosser3/wordle-5-letter-words) to create a similar experience to Wordle.

# Notes

Currently, the data set stored in the project is not accessed by the code. As such, forking this repository will not create a functional version. I have had difficulty acccessing this data due to the varying storage systems across iOS, Android, Windows, and MacOS that are accommodated through MAUI. I am hopeful that this issue will be resolved in the future.
